Introspection

1.Why must we choose you?

I honestly love coding. Getting an idea and implementing it to action is probably the best form of satisfaction as far as I am concerned. Since the club has a lot of multifaceted people, I could help myself in learning and improving my knowledge. There are a lot of "off" things about me which I could probably overcome if I join amFOSS. I'm socially super awkward. Spending time with different people might help, I am super lazy and postpone important things without any reason, I am not physically active.. ask me to blame myself, the list is just endless, so I will stop here ;)

2.What is your plan for the next 6 months?

Get into some project and do something useful.And also to get minimum CGPA of 8.5

3.How would you contribute back to the club?

I will help out people who wish to learn what I know. I will help the club in taking the right members in the forthcoming years.

4,Do you have any feedback for the selection process?

In my opinion the tasks given to us is pretty tough for beginners.Those who done 7 to 8 tasks which is medium level can be selected.
